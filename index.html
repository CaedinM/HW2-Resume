            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I was born in Hermosa Beach, California. I attended Rolling Hills Prep High School in San Pedro and I am now a 3rd year student at the University of California, Berkeley studying Data Science.
                 After I graduate, I hope to apply my Data Science skills pioneering innovations in artificial intelligence.</p>
                <p> Outside of school I am passionate about traveling, investing, andpro sports. In my free time, you might find me at the gym lifting or playing basketball, learning new things on the internet, or watching my favorite sports teams on TV.
